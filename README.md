# Flash Card Generator
A C# GUI application built in Windows Forms that allows users to create and look over sets of flash cards, saved locally on their computer.

I created this as I wanted to avoid the BS online services offer for this purpose (e.g. needing to create an account or having to pay) while being able to review college material without an internet connection. After all, if you want something done right, do it yourself.

## Features

### A UI to create sets of flash cards.
Users can set the title of the flash card set, as well as its cards' front and back text. They can create entirely new sets, or edit an existing set.

To delete a row, click on the `*` on the furthest left of a row and hit the `DEL` key on your keyboard.

### A UI to view user-created flash cards. 
Users can load sets of flash cards on their computer for reviewing. They can press a big button on the center of the window to swap between front and back contents. They have the option to switch to the next/previous card and shuffle the set at any time.

### Automatic scaling font based on card contents' length. 
This allows users to enter longer strings for cards (e.g. for lengthy definitions), and the font will re-scale so that the user can see all contents of the card regardless of their length.
